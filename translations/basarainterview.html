<h5>BASARA NEKKI INTERVIEW </h5>
This is an interview from the Seventh Moon single, translated by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/juyqe">juyqe</a>, whom I can not thank enough for their generosity!! Also thanks to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/walkingcrayon">walkingcrayon</a> for a review of the translation.
	<br>
	<br>
​<strong><i>(Translator Note)</strong> Overall tone of the interview: The interviewer is nervous. She started off the error by getting the name of the band wrong. It’s not helped at all as the interviewee seems offended and gives short one word answers. Interviewer struggles to ask a good question, but interviewee is generally annoyed and wants to go. </i>

<blockquote><strong>Q:</strong> OK! Hey everyone! Today we’re here at the most eastern tip of City 7 in Kasami Park with lead vocalist of Fire Pumper, Nekki Basara who just finished a live performance! Let’s proceed with the interview! <span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> It’s Fire Bomber.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>What?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> I said it's FIRE BOMBER.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> OH! Right right. Umm, you must be tired from the performance!<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong>I’m not tired at all.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Oh, sorry. Umm, that was a great performance huh?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Thanks
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> So, how are you?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>How am I what?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Umm, how did you feel about the performance today?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>What? What are you talking about?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>No, like, how did you personally evaluate… how did you like the ride of the performance?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> It was good.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Was it kind of like "THIS IS THE BEST"?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Ehh, it was alright. Anyways, if that’s it I’m going to go now.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Ah!! Please wait… the interview...<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Is there still more?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Umm well this is supposed to be the start of the interview.<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>I see.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Ummm, ummmm, so you, Nekki Basara, are the lead vocalist of Fire Bumper...<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>I said it’s Fire Bomber.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> OH right… Anyways, was there a time when something made you decide to do music?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Something?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Right! Like a thing, or an event?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Ehh, not really. I’ve been doing this since forever.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Oh. I see… then what about that! Like a moment where you felt "I WAS BORN TO DO ROCK!!!!!"?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>That doesn't really matter does it?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh… ummm right! It’s that isn’t it?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>What?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>In other words, "Motives don’t matter, this is everything!"... kind of feeling right?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Sure….
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Umm, let me ask you some questions about the band members.<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>The members?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Yea! What kind of people are they?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Why don’t you ask them directly?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>No, I mean, I was wondering what kind of people they are to you Mr. Basara. Are they good people?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> There’s no way they would be bad.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong>  Right, of course. What about the female vocalist, Mylene?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong> Man… what did you come here to do anyways?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>I mean, musically, do you think the hobby fits her?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> That girl is still young. She has things going on.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh? Still a kid?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Yeah.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> What kind of stuff do you think she has yet to understand?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Many things.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Like?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Even if you ask it doesn’t matter.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Oh.. well… that goes without saying… but as an example! Are there any disagreements? What kind of advice would you give her??<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> It's nothing like that.
	<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> What? What do you mean nothing?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> There’s no disagreements at all. 
​<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh really? Umm. Ummmm<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Are we done yet?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Wait! Just a bit more. What do you do on your off times?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Off times?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Yea<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>(Sigh)
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Do you do anything with your band members?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Many different things.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Do you do things all together or in divided groups?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>Oh! Um do you make music together?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>We do that.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>What is that like? <span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>What is it like?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> You know, is it like bam and the music is created, or do you think it through carefully?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>We think it through and create it.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh really? Are you pretty calculating about it?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Calculating?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Yea! Like here, we’ll gradually build up, and here this will be the climax!<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> … Why?
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>The question is why not, isn’t it?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> No.. we don’t think about those things. If you think about it you can’t make good music.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>So… what did you say you thought about?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>We think by waiting for it to come out.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> The music?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A: </strong>Yea.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: </strong>You think about that?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Yea, when it comes out, it comes out naturally.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> At what times do you get your inspirations?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> Like I said, when we’re creating music right??
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Right right. I understand now. Moving on, when the performance started, You flew out in a red Valkyrie and started singing right? I thought it was quite the flashy performance! Who’s idea was it?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> It’s not about who’s idea it was.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh… but I thought it was quite the public display!<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> We don’t do it for publicity. We do it to live.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh… but there must be some reason why you fly out...<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> I do it so you can hear my song. I’m singing so that they hear me.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh I see! Since you’re the vocalist, it’s kind of like… “I’m the song. The song is me!” kind of feeling right?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> What are you talking about?
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Oh nothing, nothing. Anyways, for the final question let me ask you what kind of music are you aiming for next?<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> There’s no that kind or this kind! It’s about feeling, and singing the music that resonates with your heart. That’s all there is to it.
<br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> I see! Yes. Thank you for the interview.<span style="line-height: .5;"><br /></span>
<strong>A:</strong> See ya.
