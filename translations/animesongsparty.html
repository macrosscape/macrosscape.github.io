  <blockquote><strong>Onishi Yohei (Henceforth OY): </strong>Here is a question from the Indonesian pop culture media channel, "GwiGwi".
  <br>

  <strong>Fukuyama Yoshiki (Henceforth FY):</strong> Ok!<br>

  <strong>OY: </strong>Could you please tell us your favorite song to perform which was the most impactful in your career as an artist? And please let us know the reason why.<br>

  <strong>FY:</strong> I am going to tell you about a song called 'Totsugeki Love Heart'. This song was one of the songs which were inserted into the TV anime called, "Macross 7". I recorded this song along with other songs in the first recording session.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong> I decided to sing anime songs but the first time I saw the lyrics saying 'Totsugeki Love Heart', I thought to myself, 'I cant do that!?' (laugh)<br>

  <strong>Hikari (Henceforth H): </strong>Did you really feel that way?<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>I almost felt like 'It's so embarrassing!' (laugh)<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>When I listened to the demo the key was quite low. It wasn't high key at all. I guess the producer didn't have enough time to work though that part as I found out the key was so high and almost my limit. I found out that the key was changed on the day of the recording. On the day of the recording! They gave me the lyrics that day too.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>I was told, 'Please sing this song today.' I recorded songs two days in a row so I recorded 6 songs all together. So that was the first recording of the TV anime 'Macross 7'. It's insane, right!?<br>

  <strong>H: </strong>It's quite tough...!<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>I almost felt like 'This song is impossible.' But then that song became my hit track day one. I never thought that the song would become such an important song for me. I am now so glad that I did my best even though it was very hard to sing in a high key.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong> It was very difficult and I had no idea how the song would turn out at that time. At that time, anime was not that popular at all. My name, 'Yoshiki Fukuyama' was not in the anime, 'Macross 7'. My name was not in the title of the song or on the CD either.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>It only said, "Song: FIRE BOMBER". So that song was one of the 6 songs which I sung during the 3 songs per day circumstances. Now, that song is one of my best hits which people recognise. I feel that this is a funny world.<br>

  <strong>H: </strong>I never imagined that this song would have such a story behind it. It must have been a very difficult experience for you.<br>

  <strong>Hikari (henceforth H):  </strong>Here is a question from a French media site about manga, "Manga News"!<br>

  <strong>Fukuyama Yoshiki (henceforth FY): </strong>Thank you so much!<br>

  <strong>H: </strong>Mr. Fukuyama has been singing all kinds of anime theme songs. I also think you tend to sing anime songs with robots in them. For example, you sang the theme songs of "Macross 7","Overman King Gainer", and "New Getter Robo".<br>

  <strong>H: </strong>Do you love anime which includes robots, right? If that you like singing theme songs of anime with robots, specifically?<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>Oh yes, since I have been singing so many anime theme songs with robots. So, it's not actually like I am crazily in love with anime that are about robots, it's just that I now have the voice for anime about robots, dont i? (laughs) People seem to believe that I love anime with robots, but that is not the case.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>The songs are all actually quite different though. When you think about "Macross 7", this song is recognized within the category of anime with robots, but if you read the lyrics there aren't any words like "Let's beat the enemy" and there are no technical names for a special move in fighting. So, I think this song is not specifically only about robots. This song, "Macross 7" is actually 100% a love song.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>I guess it's all about the impression and the voice. This year, 2022, I sang the theme song for a TV anime called, "Fantasy Bishojo Juniku Ojisan to". (Life with an Ordinary Guy who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout). This anime is in the love and comic category, but people say "When I listen to your voice, this song sounds like a passionate anime with robots." (laughs)<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>When foreigners listen to my song, they don't understand the Japanese lyrics directly. So, they hear the different songs and they all have the same feeling. That's why, "Makka na Chikai", "Fantasy Bishojo Juniku Ojisan to" and "New Getter Robo" all sound the same to them.<br>

  <strong>Onishi Yohei (henceforth OY):  </strong>Ahhhhhh!!<br>

  <strong>FY:</strong>  Even when you sing a song about heartbreak, if the song has a hard rock feel then you feel like "this is so cool!" So, I guess my songs also sound like that. So when I sing a sad song, the listener might be listening to it and get a happy feeling. I guess these things might happen tor foreign listeners.<br>

  <strong>H: </strong>Then I think it's about the compatibility of your voice.<br>

  <strong>FY: </strong>I believe so. So, I have the perfect voice for an anime with robots! (laugh)</blockquote><br>
