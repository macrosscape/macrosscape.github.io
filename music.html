PLANET DANCE<br />
Let's get started, it's Saturday night! How're you feeling? <br />
Let's stand up! Do you feel the beat? <br />
Here in our flying paradise, we've forgotten our energy. <br />
Now hurry up and take it back! <br />
<br />
No more wastin' time! Before it fades away… <br />
Like everything was just a dream! <br />
<br />
Hey, everybody!//Look to the light… <br />
And dance!//Dancin' on the Planet Dance! <br />
<br />
A liar sings a sad song of surrender. <br />
No thanks! You're no help! <br />
The changing constellations and unseen sweat and tears… <br />
Bring courage into my heart. <br />
<br />
No more wastin' love!//Don't let your love die! <br />
There's gotta be someone looking at you! <br />
<br />
Hey, everybody!//Straight from the heart… <br />
Let's shout!//Jumpin' on the Planet Dance! <br />
<br />
No more wastin' love!//I want to love you! <br />
I'll send this beat flying to tomorrow! <br />
<br />
Hey, everybody!//Look to the light… <br />
And dance!//Dancin' on the Planet Dance! <br />
<br />
Hey, everybody!//Straight from the heart… <br />
Let's shout!//Jumpin' on the Planet Dance! <br />
<br />
Hey, everybody! <br />
Hey, everybody! Yeah, yeah, yeah! <br />

TOTSUGEKI LOVE HEART <br />
Let's go! Let's break through to the dawn we dreamed of. <br />
It's still far off, but… <br />
Maybe we can make it somehow, as long as we've got love. <br />
<br />
If you listen to my song… (Listen to my song) <br />
It's so easy… (It's so easy) <br />
To bring two hearts together! <br />
<br />
My heart of love flies through the night, carrying my burning passion… <br />
Shooting down sadness and hatred! <br />
You've got a heart of love in you, too! Take your destiny head on! <br />
It can go billions of light years ahead, my charging heart of love! <br />
<br />
Let's dance! The stars are singing too!//Even a second can last forever… <br />
If you flap your wings and rock with me! <br />
Baby, we'll do it somehow, so don't let go of my hand! <br />
<br />
Listen to my song… (Listen to my song) <br />
And feel the power! (It's so easy) <br />
Don't give up 'til the very end! <br />
<br />
My heart of love flies to tomorrow, drawing a bright red trail in the sky… <br />
Spreading excitement and smiles! <br />
Everyone has a heart of love! Feel the telepathy, like sparks flying! <br />
Our soaring emotions make an aerodynamic charging heart of love! <br />
<br />

REMEMBER 16<br />
Whenever I come here, I remember…<br />
Back when I was always dreaming.<br />
The lingering wind from the stars…<br />
Takes me back to yesterday.<br />
<br />
Remember…<br />
The bright blue sky...<br />
Sixteen…<br />
Your smiling face...<br />
The thousand-year future we had planned out together...<br />
<br />
I still haven't forgotten…<br />
The promise we made.<br />
With the same strength, at the same speed…<br />
I'm still in that dream.<br />
Remember 16.<br />
<br />
As the sun set beyond the screen…<br />
You waved goodbye…<br />
And disappeared between the buildings…<br />
With the whispers of the ammonite.<br />
<br />
Remember…<br />
The smell of growing grass...<br />
Sixteen…<br />
Our first kiss...<br />
Those thunderous heartbeats we heard...<br />
<br />
I still haven't lost…<br />
That innocent love.<br />
When I'm feeling down, deep in my heart…<br />
I always remember.<br />
Remember 16.<br />
<br />
A dusty silver guitar...<br />
Those days, when we cried as we shouted,<br />
"Dreams do come true," over and over...<br />
<br />
I still haven't forgotten…<br />
The promise we made.<br />
With the same strength, at the same speed…<br />
Even now, I'm still in that dream.<br />
<br />
I still haven't lost…<br />
That innocent love.<br />
When I'm feeling down, deep in my heart…<br />
I will always remember.<br />

POWER TO THE DREAM<br />
Power to the dream!<br />
Power to the music!<br />
I just wanna see a new dream!<br />
Power to the universe!<br />
Power to the mystery!<br />
I just wanna show our power to you!<br />
<br />
That hope I'd finally grabbed hold of…<br />
Has slipped away right through my fingers.<br />
Even if it's to the bottom of the deepest black hole…<br />
I'll keep on chasing you!<br />
<br />
Power to the world!<br />
Power to the lovers!<br />
I just wanna see true love!<br />
Power to the rainbow!<br />
Power to the future!<br />
It’s all over once you give up!<br />
<br />
Those blazin' tracks a comet leaves in the sky…<br />
Are what give my melody the soul it has.<br />
Nobody can live all alone.<br />
Everybody needs somebody to love!<br />
<br />
Power to the dream!<br />
Power to the music!<br />
I just wanna see a new dream!<br />
Power to the universe!<br />
Power to the mystery!<br />
I just wanna show our power to you!<br />
<br />
Power to the dream!<br />
Power to the music!<br />
Come on, feel the power from you and me!<br />

SPIRAL ANSWER<br />
What’s my love?<br />
What should I do?<br />
Everyone keeps their hearts closed off.<br />
Such a beautiful rainbow…<br />
Why only show it to me?<br />
<br />
Baby…<br />
Please listen to my song.<br />
Why won’t you open your eyes?<br />
<br />
What’s my pain?<br />
It’s no lie.<br />
Happiness is waiting for us…<br />
We call out to each other…<br />
Maybe that’s the spiral answer.<br />
Are you dreaming all alone?<br />
<br />
Baby…<br />
Please listen to my song.<br />
Why won’t you answer me?<br />
<br />
Baby, baby, baby, baby!<br />
Please listen to my song!<br />
I want to show you the rainbow…<br />
